Rev1.0
This is a Fork from Felipe Navarro from Navarro Eletr√¥nica named momote002 to add new features on the Momote.io, there is now a LT1117-3.3 on board, to have the possibility of powering the mote with more than 3.3v, now you have a wide range of selection and can choose between the regulator and direct powering the mote with 3.3v.
We also added a PA from Texas Instruments to have up to +22dBm of Output Power and also a LNA.
